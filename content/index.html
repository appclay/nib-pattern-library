<p class="v2-paragraph">Typography helps create the structure and hierarchy of a page. This helps users read, absorb and comprehend the content. We use Roboto for headings and Open Sans for body and UI elements.</p>

<p class="v2-paragraph">These typefaces were chosen for their pairing, extensive range of weights and similarity to Helvetica.</p>
